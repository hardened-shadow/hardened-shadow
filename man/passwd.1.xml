    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      The <command>passwd</command> command changes passwords for user accounts.
      A normal user may only change the password for his/her own account, while
      the superuser may change the password for any account.
      <command>passwd</command> also changes the account or associated
      password validity period.
    </para>

    <refsect2 id='password_changes'>
      <title>Password Changes</title>
      <para>
	The user is first prompted for his/her old password, if one is
	present. This password is then encrypted and compared against the
	stored password. The user has only one chance to enter the correct
	password. The superuser is permitted to bypass this step so that
	forgotten passwords may be changed.
      </para>

      <para>
	After the password has been entered, password aging information is
	checked to see if the user is permitted to change the password at
	this time. If not, <command>passwd</command> refuses to change the
	password and exits.
      </para>

      <para>
	The user is then prompted twice for a replacement password. The
	second entry is compared against the first and both are required to
	match in order for the password to be changed.
      </para>
